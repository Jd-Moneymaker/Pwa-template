# Pwa-template
A basic template for progressive web applications(PWA). Uses responsive navigation with the help of css "media queries'

Written Html, this template can be used to make Pwa's or mobie first websites.

Using media Queries allows us to manipulate the Dom's elements depending on a device's screen size.

On large devices, the mobile navigation bar disappears and makes way for the site's navbar,
& on small devices the website's navbar disappears, and makes room for the navigation bar.
